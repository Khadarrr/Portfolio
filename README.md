Portfolio

For this assignment, I started with searching around the web for some Inspo, 
Then made a low fidelity mapping on Figma for how I wanted it to look.

In the end I went for simplicity. Describing how I am and what I work with and links to my work on the card the site and the GitHub repo.

Just keep it simple and right to the point with my work and links to the actually site and GitHub repo. Added some animations to the site to make it more fun when you enter the site, and some on the cards.

 added a skill section to showcase the programing skills i know, made it that the name pops up when you hover over the image.
